1. This was a task to carry out the sentiment analysis of few URLs.
2. Many parameters were needed to be calculated in this task as positive score, negative score, polarity score etc.
3. Stopwords and Positive, Negative words txt files were provided by the task provider as this task was given to me as an entry level task for an organization.
4. Various libraries like numpy, pandas, nltk, pyphen, BeautifulSoup, requests, re are used to carry out the desired result. 
5. BeautifulSoup is used as the main scapping tool here and regular expressions to get specified pattern or remove those patterns.
6. nltk library is used to tokenize words, sentences and pyphen is used to get the number of syllables in a words by which we get the number of complex words
